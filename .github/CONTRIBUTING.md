## Code of Conduct

We have a [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all interactions with project maintainers and fellow users.

For detailed information on issue and pull request statuses, process for testing, etc. please refer to the general [Guidelines in Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

- **Fork the Repository**: Before making changes, create a fork of the repository on your GitHub account. This allows you to make your own edits without affecting the main project code.
- **Clone your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git. This will create a local copy of the project you can work on.
- **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your specific contribution. This helps keep your changes isolated and organized.

## Set up

You will need at least [Node >= 20.19.0](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine.

Once you have the minimum Node version installed, you can continue with the rest of the repo setup.

```shell
node -v
v20.19.0

git clone https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-webcomponents.git
cd igniteui-webcomponents
npm ci
npm start
```

## Making Changes

- **Code Style**: Follow the [existing code style conventions](./CODING_GUIDELINES.md) used in the project. This might involve specific formatting guidelines or linting tools. Refer to the project's codebase or any existing documentation for details.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe your changes.
- **Testing**: Ensure your contributions include relevant tests to verify their functionality and avoid introducing regressions.

## Contributing Code

- **Pull Requests**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the main repository.
- **Pull Request Description**: Provide a detailed description of your pull request, including the issue it addresses (if applicable) and the specific changes made.
- **Code Reviews**: Be prepared to address feedback and make revisions during the code review process.

## Reporting Issues

- **Search Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, check if a similar issue has already been reported.
- **Clear and Descriptive Titles**: Use clear and descriptive titles for your issue reports to help maintainers understand the problem quickly.
- **Provide Details**: In your issue report, provide as much detail as possible to help diagnose the problem. This might include steps to reproduce the issue, error messages, and expected behavior.

Thank you!
